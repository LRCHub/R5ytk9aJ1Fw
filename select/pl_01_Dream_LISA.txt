I've been thinking
That I got no idea
What you're thinking
Are you happy?
Are you sad?
Are you always gonna hate me
For that night in Tokyo?
When it ended
I kinda hoped
That it'd be open-ended
But you never looked back
Well, I guess
You can't hold onto something
Once you let it go
But, I know a place
Where we can be us
I know it ain't real
But, it's real enough
From sun going down
To sun coming up
It's like you're here with me
Whenever I close my eyes
It's taking me back in time
Been drowning in dreams
Lately
Like it's 2019, baby
Whenever I'm missing you
Call you up
But, I can't get through
Don't know where you sleep
Lately
But, I'll see you
In my dreams, maybe
We can catch up
Drive down our old street
If all that we were
Is all that we'll ever be
It's bittersweet
At least a girl can dream
I guess that I'm taking
What I can get
'Cause I don't get
Nothing new from your friends
If you got
The harder side of the break
Then why
Is it harder for me to take?
There's so much
I might never get to say, ay
But, I know a place
Where we can be us
I know it ain't real
But, it's real enough
From sun going down
To sun coming up
It's like you're here with me
Whenever I close my eyes
It's taking me back in time
Been drowning in dreams
Lately
Like it's 2019, baby
Whenever I'm missing you
Call you up
But, I can't get through
Don't know where you sleep
Lately
But, I'll see you
In my dreams, maybe
We can catch up
Drive down our old street
If all that we were
Is all that we'll ever be
It's bittersweet
At least a girl can dream
I know it's only in my mind
Playin' three nights on the stereo
Like a movie scene, DiCaprio
Oh, I put my makeup on
Just to fall asleep
It's like you're here with me
Whenever I close my eyes
It's taking me back in time
Been drowning in dreams
Lately
Like it's 2019, baby
Whenever I'm missing you
Call you up
But, I can't get through
Don't know where you sleep
Lately
But, I'll see you
In my dreams, maybe
We can catch up
Drive down our old street
If all that we were
Is all that we'll never be
It's bittersweet
Can we be friends at least?
